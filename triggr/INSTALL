Triggr requires libev library in a version 3.0 or later; version 4.x is strongly 
suggested. libev is a free software available from:
 http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html

You probably don't have it installed, but it is present in most Linux distributions' 
repositories, in particular:
- Fedora, CentOS, RHEL, SUSE: libev-devel
- Debian, Ubuntu, Mint: libev-dev
- Arch, Gentoo: libev

Triggr also utilises POSIX Threads (pthreads), which must be supported by the OS and 
compiler; your system most likely supports it already. 

Both dependencies should be checked and resolved by the configure script invoked
by package installation. If not, please contact the author.

In case you can't or don't want to install libev in standard location, you must
download triggr package and install it manually setting some environmental variables;
supposing libev is in /opt/libev/, you should install triggr with:

 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/libev/lib \
 CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/libev/include \
 LDFLAGS=-L/opt/libev/lib \
 R CMD INSTALL triggr_0.3.tar.gz

and keep in mind that /opt/libev/lib must be in in LD_LIBRARY_PATH when you load and
use triggr.

Triggr 0.3 is not supporting Windows and a port is not currently planned.
The support for non-Linux *NIXes (including OS X) is theoretical, i.e. triggr is
not tested on those platforms, and while it relies heavily on specialised kernel
features the chance of some unexpected problems is significant.
